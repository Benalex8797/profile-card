# Profile Card

This is my HNG Stage 1 project, where I created a Profile Card using HTML, CSS, and a bit of creativity. The card displays basic personal information such as my name, role, and contact links. It was designed to showcase my ability to structure web content, style with CSS, and build a clean, responsive layout.

A sleek, interactive profile card webpage showcasing personal information, social links, hobbies, and dislikes with a modern glassmorphism design. The project includes multiple pages: a main profile card, an about page with detailed personal information, and a contact page with a functional form.

## Features

- **Profile Header**: Displays profile picture, name, bio, and live-updating current time.
- **Social Links**: Direct links to Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub with hover animations and brand-specific colors.
- **Hobbies Section**: Lists personal interests in a visually appealing tag format.
- **Dislikes Section**: Highlights personal dislikes in a similar tag style.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Mobile Sidebar Navigation**: On screens smaller than 700px, navigation links are hidden in a hover-activated sidebar that slides in from the left with a glassmorphism effect.
- **Animations**: Includes floating profile picture, gradient background animation, and hover effects.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Semi-transparent card with blur effects and subtle shadows.
- **About Page**: Detailed personal information including bio, goals, areas of low confidence, and notes to future self.
- **Contact Page**: Functional contact form with client-side validation and success messaging.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3**: Styling with animations, flexbox, and media queries.
- **JavaScript**: Simple script for updating the current time every second, and form validation on the contact page.

## Pages

- **index.html**: Main profile card page with personal information, social links, hobbies, and dislikes.
- **about.html**: Detailed about page including bio, goals, areas of low confidence, and personal notes.
- **contact.html**: Contact form page with validation and success messaging.
