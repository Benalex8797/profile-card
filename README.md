# Profile Card

This is my HNG Stage 0 project, where I created a Profile Card using HTML, CSS, and a bit of creativity. The card displays basic personal information such as my name, role, and contact links. It was designed to showcase my ability to structure web content, style with CSS, and build a clean, responsive layout.

A sleek, interactive profile card webpage showcasing personal information, social links, hobbies, and dislikes with a modern glassmorphism design.

## Features

- **Profile Header**: Displays profile picture, name, bio, and live-updating current time.
- **Social Links**: Direct links to Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub with hover animations and brand-specific colors.
- **Hobbies Section**: Lists personal interests in a visually appealing tag format.
- **Dislikes Section**: Highlights personal dislikes in a similar tag style.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Animations**: Includes floating profile picture, gradient background animation, and hover effects.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Semi-transparent card with blur effects and subtle shadows.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3**: Styling with animations, flexbox, and media queries.
- **JavaScript**: Simple script for updating the current time every second.

## How to View

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. The profile card will load with all interactive elements.

No server or build process is required as this is a static webpage.
